<h1>GINGYMAN</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Kristina's Gingyman!</h2>
This game is another version of Spaceman. The outcome of this game is to guess a letter and see if the letter is displayed in the underscore(s). There are six chances given, and each incorrect letter guessed will remove a piece of Gingy.
<br />
<br />
When the player selects a letter, the letter will not be able to be clicked again. All buttons are a shade of yellowish brown and if an incorrect letter is guessed, the button color will change to red. Otherwise, if a correct letter is guessed, the letter will replace the underscore(s), and the button color will change to green. Once a letter is clicked, the player will not be able to click the same letter.
<br />
<br />
If the player uses all six chances, a message will pop up indicating that the player lost, and the play again button will pop up. Or if the player is able to guess the word, a congratulatory message will pop up, and the play again button will pop up as well. Whether the player won or lost the game, the secret word will be revealed.
